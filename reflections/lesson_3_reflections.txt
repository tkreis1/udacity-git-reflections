When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Good for backups and for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can be selective about when to pull changes and do so at logical checkpoints.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - copy one repository on GitHub to another repository on GitHub. No local download needed as
go-between. Good for copying something from another repository that you plan to share after making
changes.

Clones - Copy one repository to another locally or from GitHub to your computer.

Branches - Occur within one repository. Good for when making experimental changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work with the latest info offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Collaborating without Git or GitHub would likely be more difficult as you would have to send/share large groups of files via email or service such as Dropbox. It would be more difficult to merge work and could be more challenging to make comparisons between versions.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Make changes in a separate branch when experimenting with adjusting the code so you don't lose your progress if you make a mistake. Making changes directly is master is more convenient, but you risk having broken code when you make a change and don't come back to it immediately.
