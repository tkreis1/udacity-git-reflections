When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Good for backups and for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can be selective about when to pull changes and do so at logical checkpoints.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - copy one repository on GitHub to another repository on GitHub. No local download needed as
go-between. Good for copying something from another repository that you plan to share after making
changes.

Clones - Copy one repository to another locally or from GitHub to your computer.

Branches - Occur within one repository. Good for when making experimental changes.
