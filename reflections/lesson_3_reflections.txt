When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Good for backups and for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can be selective about when to pull changes and do so at logical checkpoints.
